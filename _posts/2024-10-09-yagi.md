The Yagi antenna or Yagi-Uda antenna is a directional antenna Invented in 1930. This invention advanced conventional antennas, meaning that through a simple dipole structure, combined with parasitic elements known as reflectors and directors, a directional antenna could be built.

This type of antenna is very similar to the potatoes antenna that appears in a Mr Robot episode. In this article I will be explaining how to create one of these antennas.

## Materials

The materials to create a Yagi antenna are the following:

 - 1 PVC tube (width 1.5cm)
 - 24ft 12 Gauge Copper
 - 1 Cap of Coca-Cola
 - 1 Coaxial Cable 6ft
 - 1 Wi-Fi Adapter
 - 1 RP-SMA female adapter
 - 1 Coaxial Thread
 - 1 Piece of Cardboard
 - Hot Silicone
 - 1 small screw

In the image below we have some plans to start creating our antenna. Credits to [Pokexemo](https://www.pokoxemo.com/)

## Process

### Step 1: Measure the PVC pipe with measurements of 2.5cm and from these measurements begin to make the 17 holes.

### Step 2: Cut the copper pieces from 5.2cm to 4.2cm.
Cut the elements (pieces of copper) to a certain size. The pieces of copper are cut from largest to smallest.

Use 17 elements and cut 4.2cm until gradually 5.2cm. Mark the socks from which the elements must be let out when gluing them to the PVC pipe.

### Step 3: Create the dipole by making an oval of 5cm x 4cm.

Glue the dipole as is showed in the image.

Make sure that the dipole is making contact with the coaxial cable. You can solder the coppers to be safer.

### Step 4: Glue the copper pieces into the holes.

Glue the elements into the holes. Paste based on the measurements to which our elements had to come out.
Proceed to glue the elements into the existing holes.

### Step 5: Create coaxial cable and adapt it with the RP-SMA female adapter.

### Step 6: Connect the antenna to the WiFi adapter, and connect it to the computer.
Connect your wifi adapter to your antenna so you can start using it.

## Using and testing the antenna

Now let's do some test to our antenna. I will be using kismet to do the test it.

After doing some monitoring with kismet, I can prove that the antenna works :).
