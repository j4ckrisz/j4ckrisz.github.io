Hi there! I'm Bryan López (aka j4ckrisz), a passionate Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, software development, and hands-on problem solving. I enjoy building projects that combine logic, creativity, and real-world impact.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in Linux, scripting (Python, Bash), web technologies, and offensive security techniques. I maintain a GitBook where I document my cybersecurity journey and contribute open-source tools and writeups.
